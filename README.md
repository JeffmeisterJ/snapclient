# Snapcast client for ESP32

### Synchronous Multiroom audio streaming client for [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) ported to ESP32

## Feature list
- Opus and PCM decoding currently supported
- Wifi setup from menuconfig
- Auto connect to snapcast server on network
- Buffers up to 150 ms on Wroom modules
- Buffers more then enough on Wrover modules
- Multiroom sync delay controlled from Snapcast server 400ms - 2000ms

## Description
I have continued the work from @badaix and @bridadan towards a ESP32 Snapcast
client. Currently it support basic features like multirum sync, network
controlled volume and mute. For now it only support Opus and PCM 16bit/48Khz
audio streams and the synchornization part is still being worked on.

Please check out the task list and feel free to fill in.

I have used the Infineon MA12070P Multi level Class D combined coded/amp due to
its superior power effecienty on a high supply rail. It allows battery power
system with good playback time at normal listen level and still have the power
to start the party.

### Codebase

The codebase is split into components and build on vanilla ESP-IDF. I still
have some refactoring on the todo list as the concept has started to settle and
allow for new features can be added in a structured manner. In the code you
will find parts that are only partly related features and still not on the task
list.

Components
 - MerusAudio : Low level communication interface MA12070P
 - opus : Opus audio coder/decoder full submodule
 - rtprx : Alternative RTP audio client UDP low latency also opus based
 - lightsnapcast : Port of @bridadan scapcast packages decode library
 - libbuffer : Generic buffer abstraction
 - esp-dsp : Submodule to the ESP-ADF done by David Douard
 - dsp_processor : Audio Processor and I2S low level interface including sync
   buffer

The snapclient functionanlity are implemented in a task included in main - but
will be refactored to a component in near future.

Sync concept has been changed start 2021 on this implementation and differ a
bit from the way original snap clints handle this.

The snapclient frontend handles communiction with the server and after
successfully hello hand shake it dispatches packages from the server.

 - CODEC_HEADER : Setup client audio codec (FLAC, OPUS, OGG or PCM) bitrate, n
   channels and bits pr sample
 - WIRE_CHUNK : Coded audio data
 - SERVER_SETTING : Channel volume, mute state, playback delay etc
 - TIME : Ping pong time keeping packages to keep track of time dif from server
   to client

Each wire_chunk of audio data comes with a timestamp and client has agreed play
that sample playback-delay after the timestamp. One way to handle that is to
pass on audio data to a buffer with a length that compensate for for
playback-delay, network jitter and DAC to speaker.

In this implementation I have separated the sync task to a backend on the other
end of a large ring buffer. Now the front end just need to pass on the audio
data to the ring buffer with the server timestamp and chunk size. The backen
read timestamps and waits until the audio chunk has the correct playback-delay
to be written to the DAC amplifer speaker pipeline. When the backend pipeline
is in sync, any offset get rolled in by micro tuning the APLL on the ESP. No
sample manipulation needed.

## Build

Clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/jorgenkraghjakobsen/snapclient

Update third party code (opus and esp-dsp):

    git submodule update --init

Configure to match your setup
  - Wifi network name and password
  - Audio coded setup

    idf.py menuconfig

Build, compile and flash:

    idf.py build flash monitor

## Test
Setup a snapcast server on your network

On a linux box:

Clone snapcast build and start the server

    ./snapserver

Pipe some audio to the snapcast server fifo

    mplayer http://ice1.somafm.com/secretagent-128-aac -ao pcm:file=/tmp/snapfifo -af format=s16LE -srate 48000

Test the server config on other knowen platform

    ./snapclient  from the snapcast repo

Android : snapclient from the app play store

## Contribute

You are very welcome to help and provide [Pull
Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
to the project.

We strongly suggest you activate [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks in
this git repository before starting to hack and make commits.

Assuming you have `pre-commit` installed on your machine (using `pip install
pre-commit` or, on a debian-like system, `sudo apt install pre-commit`), type:

```
:~/snapclient$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Then on every `git commit`, a few sanity/formatting checks will be performed.


## Task list
- [ok] Fix to alinge with above
 * kconfig
 * add codec description
- [ ] Integrate ESP wifi provision
- [ok] Find and connect to Avahi broadcasted Snapcast server name
- [ ] Add a client command interface layer like volume/mute control
- [ ] Build a ESP-ADF branch

## Minor task
- [ ] Propergate mute/unute from server message to DSP backend mute control.
  - [ ] soft mute - play sample in buffer with decreasing volume
  - [ok] hard mute - pass on zero at the DSP hackend
- [ ] Startup: do not start parsing on samples to codec before sample ring buffer hits requested buffer size.
  - [ok] Start from empty buffer
